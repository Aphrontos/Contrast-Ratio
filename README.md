# Contrast-Ratio
2 implementations of finding the pair of colors whose contrast ratio is the closest to 1≤x∈ℤ≤21

Both implementations are console only.

The C implementation is takes ~3 days to find the pair on an AMD Ryzen 7 4700U with Radeon Graphics CPU. Even with parallelization.

The C++ implementation takes ~1 seconds to find the pair on the same CPU with no parallelization.
